<p align="center"><img src="DemoImages/channel_top.png" width="600" alt="CueVote App Demo"></p>

**CueVote** is a modern, community-driven social jukebox built for the YouTube era. It democratizes music selection by allowing everyone in the room to suggest songs and vote on the queue in real-time.

Whether you're hosting a house party, running a bar, or just hanging out online, CueVote ensures the best songs play next — decided by the crowd, not an algorithm.
